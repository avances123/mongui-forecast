Introduction
------------

This is proof of concept to forecast some geodiversity based in SRTMs, land cover data, and satellite precipitation measurements, makes use of postgis raster fundamentally.

As much as naive I can be, I want to forecast life appareance of one kind of mushroom wich shows up near my home town and is very apreciated by the locals. I know some characteristics they need to appear, they appear at some altitude, on a specific type of terrain, and they need several water on them followed to a warm period. Tipically for mushrooms I think.
